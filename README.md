# Description
Customisable start page for quickly accessing your most important bookmarks.

Provides a customisable start page with bookmark management.  
Add bookmarks from open tabs and your existing bookmark manager, grouping them in to collections.  
Quickly access your bookmarks every time you open a new tab.

Choose which of your existing bookmark folders to show, or create new ones for Booksmart.  
Position them on the dashboard, and choose icons, colours, and background images, so everything looks how you want.  
You can even tag folders to quickly hide any that you don't currently need.

Everything is stored in your Chrome profile and synced using through your browser account, so nothing is kept externally and you don't need to create a new account.  
If you need to share a single folder or your whole Booksmart dashboard, you can export them for import to another account.
